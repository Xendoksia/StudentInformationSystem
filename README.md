StudentInformationSystem is a role-based web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core, designed for managing students, teachers, lessons, grades, and announcements in an educational institution. It features a secure login system using cookie-based authentication, with separate dashboards for admins, teachers, and students. The admin panel allows CRUD operations on all entities, including user management with auto-generated usernames and passwords based on identity numbers.

Teachers can manage lessons and grade entries, while students can securely view their personal data, academic calendar, and grades. The project uses a responsive design with Bootstrap 4. Data is stored in a SQL Server database and queried efficiently using LINQ and Entity Framework's code-first approach.

The application structure follows clean MVC architecture, separating concerns and making the project easy to maintain and extend. Ideal for educational environments or as a learning project for mastering .NET technologies and full-stack development.
